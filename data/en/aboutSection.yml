  ### Where you are, we are there

  The PSG Club Montreal was founded in 2009 in order to allow PSG fans
  in Montreal to find each other, and to live their passion even 6000km from Paris.


  Since its creation, the association has allowed its members to meet at each match
  of PSG to vibrate to the rhythm of the exploits of the reds and blues, to proudly wear the
  colors of the association in the soccer leagues of Quebec, and to organize events
  unique such as trips (Paris, New York, Toronto, Columbus, Detroit ...) to cheer for Paris
  at the Parc des Princes and outside its bases.
