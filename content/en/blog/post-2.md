### ‚öΩ A Match Dominated by Paris, but Marred by Three More Injuries
At 11:00 AM, the atmosphere intensified as the players walked onto the pitch at the Parc des Princes, broadcast live. PSG quickly delighted the Montreal supporters thanks to an outstanding Bradley Barcola. The Parisian forward scored a decisive brace (15th and 51st minutes), both times assisted by an inspired Vitinha.

Dominating the game, the Parisians were generally in control, leaving few opportunities for Lens, who were limited to a few timid counter-attacks. The Parisian defense proved solid, and goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier had a relatively quiet afternoon.

However, three Parisian players had to leave the field due to injury and were substituted. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Lee Kang-In, and Lucas Beraldo (who was stretchered off) were injured one by one, creating apprehension among the PSG Club Montr√©al members just days before the first European fixture against Atalanta Bergamo.

### üî• Montreal Atmosphere, Parisian Passion
While the Parc des Princes was buzzing in Paris, Montreal was not to be outdone: cheers, chants, and tactical analyses between sips of coffee‚Äîthe Parisian community proved once again that it knows how to recreate the soul of PSG far from the capital.

Each of Barcola's goals was met with an explosion of joy, punctuated by passionate discussions about the team's renewed offensive efficiency and collective strength.

### ‚úÖ A Successful Event
With this 2-0 victory, PSG solidifies its top position in Ligue 1 and confirms its positive momentum. For their part, the members of PSG Club Montr√©al leave with warm memories of a Sunday morning unlike any other.

This PSG Club Montr√©al brunch perfectly fulfilled its role: to unite, to share, and to celebrate. And one thing is certain: the passion for PSG continues to shine far beyond the borders of France, right into the heart of Montreal.
