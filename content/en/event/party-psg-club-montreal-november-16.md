PSG Club Montreal Social Event this Thursday, November 16 from 6 p.m.

Join us for this social event. An opportunity to meet Paris Saint Germain supporters, to share your feedback and your hopes after the first matches, but above all to have fun in an exceptional atmosphere.

Games will take place throughout the evening, with jerseys, caps, scarves and many other gifts to be won.

We will also ask your opinions about new exciting projects to launch throughout the season for PSG Club Montréal, on the eve of its 15th anniversary.

Come many!
